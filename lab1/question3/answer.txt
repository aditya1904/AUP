3. What will be the output for the program with following operation?
    Create a new file “f1” and write “abcde” in it and close
    Open the file “f1” for writing with O_APPEND flag
    lseek to the beginning of the file
    Replace the existing data in the file with “12345”
Justify your answer.

The file will be "abcde12345" at the end of all the steps. Since the file is opened with the O_APPEND flag, the contents always get written
at the end of the file.
-- A snippet from manpage of "write" (man 2 write) --
    If the file was open(2)ed with O_APPEND, the file offset is first set to the end of the file before writing.  The adjustment of the file offset
    and the write operation are performed as an atomic step.

To verify, try the code que3.c .
